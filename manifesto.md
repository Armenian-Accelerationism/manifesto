This document represents the current state of the manifesto for Armenian Accelerationism, also known as arm/acc or ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡²/acc.

The movement is inspired by decentralized communities such as Effective Accelerationism (e/acc), TPOT, and others, with notable implicit and explicit leaders like Beff Jezos (Guillaume Verdon), Elon Musk, Garry Tan, and many more.

The overarching goal of arm/acc is to improve the Republic of Armenia (or simply Armenia) and the lives of Armenians worldwide, wherever they are in our vast and widely dispersed diaspora.

Our definition of Armenian is similar to how most Americans define being American. Weâ€™re a community, a movement driven by a simple yet effective ideology. What makes you Armenian isnâ€™t just birth or ancestry â€“ itâ€™s alignment with our shared vision, values, and goals. Itâ€™s what you think and do, not where youâ€™re from or who your parents are.

Writing this out, I realize this idea first came to me years ago, during one of our slightly drunk pub hangouts in Yerevan. My high school friend Arman, after a jug or two of beer, would launch into one of his monologues â€“ sometimes on his own, sometimes in the middle of a heated debate about life, politics, Armenia, and the world. And every time, heâ€™d say the same thing.
Heâ€™d say we were the true Armenians. That many of the people around us, even in our own capital, didnâ€™t deserve the name. And then heâ€™d turn to me â€“ the teenager raging against his family, his country, and his religion â€“ and call me a true Armenian. Because I cared.

Being Armenian is a choice â€“ in geopolitically complicated and mentally exhausting times like these, where existential risk surrounds us and hope requires deliberate effort, all we can do is believe, share our radically optimistic vision with our comrades, and build toward a better future, together. 

Armenian Accelerationism welcomes everyone â€“ explicitly as a community member on X or implicitly by taking actions that align with our goals â€“ regardless of location, ethnicity, nationality, gender, political stance, religion, language, geopolitical identity, diaspora or homeland status, age, or economic background. While we hope that citizens of the Republic of Armenia and diasporan Armenians will be our early adopters, we stand by our definition of what it means to be Armenian.

We are radically â€“ even delusionally â€“ optimistic about Armeniaâ€™s future, both as a state and as a community. We see Armenia gradually emerging as a major technological hub, and one of our goals is to accelerate this transformation.

We recognize ongoing efforts to improve education â€“ with one of the most notable being the Generation AI project by FAST Foundation â€“ and our second goal is to accelerate these educational advancements. 

The Armenian startup scene is growing, and we deeply believe it holds the key to dramatically improving the economy â€“ one of the few ways to generate substantial capital seemingly from thin air.

We agree that Armeniaâ€™s greatest export is its human capital, but we believe it must also become the countryâ€™s most valuable asset for internal development. There is immense value in studying and working abroad â€“ for both the individual and the country â€“ but this value is lost when individuals leave permanently because Armenia fails to provide the opportunities they need to flourish.

We believe there is still much work to be done to align the countryâ€™s incentives with those of its most passionate, hard-working, influential, and successful members. We strongly prefer meritocracy over bureaucracy and see the dominance of the latter as a major reason why so much talent leaves Armenia in search of better opportunities abroad.

To summarize, we see Armenian Accelerationism as a hyperstitious idea that should spread throughout the Armenian community â€“ benefiting individuals, cities, states, the country, and the diaspora as larger entities. We want to inspire every Armenian â€“ no matter their age â€“ but with a special focus on the younger generation, to build. To believe in themselves and their national identity, and to channel that passion into execution, creating a brighter future for all of us.

If you want to show your affiliation with us, you can add arm/acc or ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡²/acc to your social media name or bio, pin the community in the highlighted section of your profile, or spread the word in whatever way feels right â€“ online or in real life.

If you want to support us, follow us on the social media platforms you use. Our main presence is on X, with some activity on LinkedIn and an older community on Discord. If youâ€™d like to support us in other ways â€“ through funding, expertise, or connections â€“ reach out to us. That said, to be completely clear, our current goals donâ€™t involve funding, so while appreciated, itâ€™s not necessary â€“ at least not yet.

Weâ€™re tired of the looming sense of doom, demotivation, and negativity spreading through our community. We believe every Armenian should be able to call themselves Armenian and feel a deep, unwavering pride as they say it.
We are not affiliated with any organization â€“ religious, political, or private. We are our own movement, spread by its original founders and anyone who believes in it enough to join the effort. It is decentralized and as open as we can safely make it.

Join us â€“ letâ€™s build a better Armenia together.
